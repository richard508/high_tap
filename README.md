# High Tap, "Tapping the Market at the highest level"
## Overview

For project #2, I created a simple social media app. In this day and age social media, influencers have thousands and millions of followers. They create good and sometimes bad content but regardless they have a lot of followers. However when it comes to getting paid they get pennies on the dollar. Social media giants like Facebook and Twitter they take the bulk of the money. My app works the other way around. You have the followers and we get the a cut for providing the service. We match advertisers and influencers together. They create their magic and rip the benefits while we are along for the ride.
